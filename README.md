# [Penetration Testing](https://h1dz.github.io/Pen-Testing/)  


## **Welcome!**
 

This page will link to scripts I have made that are orientated towards penetration testing, enumeration and post exploitation. These scripts have been useful to me while studying Penetration Testing and also participating in Capture The Flags. 

## These notes are subject to change as I am constantly learning and updating them!              

### [Scripts](https://github.com/h1dz/Pen-Testing/tree/Scripts)
