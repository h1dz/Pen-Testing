## **Welcome!**
 

This page will link to notes on my github orientated towards Kali Linux & Pen Testing.   
This git contains code, tools, methods & other miscellaneous commands I've taken down that I've found helpful. 

I have taken these notes while learning about Penetration Testing, Cyber Security, Kali Linux and now currently studying for Security+ and OSCP.
These notes are subject to change as I am constantly learning.
