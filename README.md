# Scripts
   
The following scripts are not final versions yet, but still work fine.
  
## smb3num.sh
This bash script will enumerate SMB shares on port 445   
-lists shares   
-share info   
-crackmap   
-anonymous login attempt   
-checks login through wwwroot   
   
## searchsploitLAZY.sh
Simple script that is for the lazy people like me out there, instead of having to type searchsploit <service> <version>, it just shorthands searchsploit to the letter s.   
Rename to s    
Usage: ./s <service> <version>
