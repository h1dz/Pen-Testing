# [Penetration Testing](https://h1dz.github.io/Pen-Testing/)  


## **Welcome!**
 

This page will link to scripts I have made that are orientated towards penetration testing, enumeration and post exploitation. These scripts have been found useful to me while learning about Penetration Testing and also conducting Capture The Flags. 

## These notes are subject to change as I am constantly learning and updating them!
